    "\n",
    "Why is this method appropriate?\n",
    "Linear regression is a simple and widely used method for exploring relationships between response variables and explanatory variables. It provides interpretable coefficients showing how each feature affects the likelihood of subscription. And it performs well with small sample sizes and mixed numeric/categorical predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which assumptions are required, if any, to apply the method selected?\n",
    "1.Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "2.The explanatory variables are not highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "3.The relationship between response variables and explanatory variables is approximately linear.\n",
    "4.The variance of the errors is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected?\n",
    "1.Because the response variable is binary, linear regression might predict values outside the range, which do not directly represent probabilities.\n",
    "2.It assumes linearity and constant variance, which may not hold perfectly in this dataset.\n",
    "3.It can be sensitive to outliers, especially when a few players have extremely high playtime or session counts.\n",
